## 0.1.2 (2014-03-xx)

* Fix: Compatibility with PHP 5.3 by using $that reference within closures
  (#1)

## 0.1.1 (2014-01-24)

* Fix: Work around [an issue](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=698683)
  in Zenity 3.8 which essentially broke selecting items from lists (tables,
  menus, radioboxes etc.) via double-click or hitting enter. This workaround is
  safe for both affected and unaffected versions.

* First tagged release
